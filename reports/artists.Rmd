Do the artists of Magic: The Gathering have preferences? Mana color, creature
types, or anything of that sort?

## Exploration

```{r loadData}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)

theme_set(theme_minimal())

load('../data/cards.RData')
load('../data/sets.RData')

cards <- cards[sets, on = 'setCode']
```

How many artists have their been over the years?

```{r count}
length(unique(cards$artist))
```

That's a lot. Who's in the top as far as number of cards?

```{r topCount}
artist_works <- table(cards$artist)
head(sort(artist_works, decreasing = TRUE))
```

I actually remember some of those names. Dan Frazier is from the older sets, and
Mark Tedin sounds familiar. I started playing when Ice Age was the new thing.
Let's see when these artists were pumping out cards.

```{r timeline}
timeline <- cards[
  ,
  list(count = .N),
  keyby = c('artist', 'setCode')
]
```
